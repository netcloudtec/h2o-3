/** A NFS distributed file-backed Vector
 *  <p>
 *  Vec will be lazily loaded from the NFS file on-demand.  Each machine is
 *  expected to have the <b>same</b> filesystem view onto a file with the same
 *  byte contents.  Each machine will lazily load only the sections of the file
 *  that are assigned to that machine.  Basically, the file starts striped
 *  across some globally visible file system (e.g. NFS, or just replicated on
 *  local disk) and is loaded into memory - again striped across the machines -
 *  without any network traffic or data-motion.
 *  <p>
 *  Useful to "memory map" into RAM large datafiles, often pure text files.
