 * Represents a two-argument function

 * We could as well use Google guava library, but Guava's functions are not serializable.
 * We need serializable functions, to be able to pass them over the cloud.

 * A two-argument function, in abstract settings, is something that takes values of given type (X and Y) and returns a value of a given type (Z). 
 * @see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)">wikipedia</a> for details.
