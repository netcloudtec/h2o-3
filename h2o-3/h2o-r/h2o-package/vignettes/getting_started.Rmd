## Downloading and Installing

Perform the following steps in R to install H2O. Copy and paste these commands one line at a time.

Remove any previously installed packages for R.

```
if ("package:h2o" %in% search()) { detach("package:h2o", unload=TRUE) }
if ("h2o" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) { remove.packages("h2o") }
```

Next, download packages that H2O depends on.

```
pkgs <- c("RCurl","jsonlite")
for (pkg in pkgs) {
  if (! (pkg %in% rownames(installed.packages()))) { install.packages(pkg) }
}
```

Download and install the latest H2O package for R.

```
install.packages("h2o", type="source", repos=(c("http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/latest_stable_R")))
```

Initialize H2O and run a demo to see H2O at work.

```
library(h2o)
h2o.init()
demo(h2o.kmeans)
```
