They are composed of 4177 observations on 9 attributes. All attributes are real valued, and continuous, except for Sex and Rings, found in columns 1 and 9 respectively.\nSex is categorical with 3 levels (male, female, and infant), and Rings is an integer valued count.\n\nIf you don't have any data of your own to work with, you can find some example datasets at <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php</a>.\n\nThe goal of this example is to use the Abalone dataset to predict the number of rings (C9), based on the other attributes:\n - sex (C1)\n - length (C2)\n - diameter (C3)\n - height (C4)\n - whole weight (C5)\n - shucked weight (C6)\n - viscera weight (C7)\n - shell weight (C8)\n\n#### Importing Data\nBefore creating a model, import data into H2O:\n\n0. Click the **Assist Me!** button (the last button in the row of buttons below the menus).\n  ![Assist Me](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h2oai/h2o-3/master/h2o-docs/src/product/flow/images/Flow_AssistMeButton.png)\n0. Click the **importFiles** link and enter the file path to the dataset in the **Search** entry field. For this example, the dataset is available at https://s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-public-test-data/smalldata/flow_examples/abalone.csv.gz. \n0. Click the **Add all** link to add the file to the import queue, then click the **Import** button. "

      "input": "### Parsing Data\nNow, parse the imported data: \n\n0. Click the **Parse these files...** button. \n\n  **Note**: The default options typically do not need to be changed unless the data does not parse correctly. \n\n0. From the drop-down **Parser** list, select the file type of the data set (Auto, XLS, CSV, or SVMLight). \n0. If the data uses a separator, select it from the drop-down **Separator** list. \n0. If the data uses a column header as the first row, select the **First row contains column names** radio button. If the first row contains data, select the **First row contains data** radio button. To have H2O automatically determine if the first row of the dataset contains column names or data, select the **Auto** radio button. \n0. If the data uses apostrophes ( `'` - also known as single quotes), check the **Enable single quotes as a field quotation character** checkbox. \n0. To delete the imported dataset after parsing, check the **Delete on done** checkbox. \n\n  **NOTE**: In general, we recommend enabling this option. Retaining data requires memory resources, but does not aid in modeling because unparsed data cannot be used by H2O.\n\n0. Review the data in the **Edit Column Names and Types** section, then click the **Parse** button.  \n\n  **NOTE**: Make sure the parse is complete by confirming progress is 100% before continuing to the next step, model building. For small datasets, this should only take a few seconds, but larger datasets take longer to parse.\n"
