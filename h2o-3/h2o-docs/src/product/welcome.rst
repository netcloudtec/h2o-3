Welcome to H2O 3
================

H2O is an open source, in-memory, distributed, fast, and scalable machine learning and predictive analytics platform that allows you to build machine learning models on big data and provides easy productionalization of those models in an enterprise environment.

H2O's core code is written in Java. Inside H2O, a Distributed Key/Value store is used to access and reference data, models, objects, etc., across all nodes and machines. The algorithms are implemented on top of H2O's distributed Map/Reduce framework and utilize the Java Fork/Join framework for multi-threading. The data is read in parallel and is distributed across the cluster and stored in memory in a columnar format in a compressed way. H2O’s data parser has built-in intelligence to guess the schema of the incoming dataset and supports data ingest from multiple sources in various formats.

H2O’s REST API allows access to all the capabilities of H2O from an external program or script via JSON over HTTP. The Rest API is used by H2O’s web interface (Flow UI), R binding (H2O-R), and Python binding (H2O-Python).

The speed, quality, ease-of-use, and model-deployment for the various cutting edge Supervised and Unsupervised algorithms like Deep Learning, Tree Ensembles, and GLRM make H2O a highly sought after API for big data data science.

New User Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New users can follow the steps below to quickly get up and running with H2O directly from the **h2o-3** repository. These steps guide you through cloning the repository, starting H2O, and importing a dataset. Once you're up and running, you'll be better able to follow examples included within this user guide.

1. In a terminal window, create a folder for the H2O repository. The example below creates a folder called "repos" on the desktop.

 ::

   user$ mkdir ~/Desktop/repos

2. Change directories to that new folder, and then clone the repository. Notice that the prompt changes when you change directories.

 ::

    user$ cd ~/Desktop/repos
    repos user$ git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3.git

3. After the repo is cloned, change directories to the **h2o** folder.

 ::

    repos user$ cd h2o-3
    h2o-3 user$

4. Run the following command to retrieve sample datasets. These datasets are used throughout this User Guide and within the `Booklets <http://www.h2o.ai/resources/>`_.

 ::

   h2o-3 user$ ./gradlew syncSmalldata

At this point, determine whether you want to complete this quick start in either R or Python, and run the corresponding commands below from either the R or Python tab.

Refer to `https://anaconda.org/h2oai/h2o/files <https://anaconda.org/h2oai/h2o/files>`__ to view a list of available H2O versions. Anaconda users can refer to the `Install on Anaconda Cloud <downloading.html#install-on-anaconda-cloud>`__ section for information about installing H2O in an Anaconda Cloud.

R Users
-------

Currently, the only version of R that is known to be incompatible with H2O is R version 3.1.0 (codename "Spring Dance"). If you are using that version, we recommend upgrading the R version before using H2O.

To check which version of H2O is installed in R, use ``versions::installed.versions("h2o")``.

-  `R User HTML <../h2o-r/docs/index.html>`__ and `R User PDF <../h2o-r/h2o_package.pdf>`__ Documentation: This document contains all commands in the H2O package for R, including examples and arguments. It represents the definitive guide to using H2O in R.

-  `RStudio Cheat Sheet <https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/h2o.pdf>`__: Download this PDF to keep as a quick reference when using H2O in R.  

**Note**: If you are running R on Linux, then you must install ``libcurl``, which allows H2O to communicate with R. We also recommend disabling SElinux and any firewalls, at least initially until you have confirmed H2O can initialize.

- On Ubuntu, run: ``apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev``
- On CentOs, run: ``yum install libcurl-devel``

API Users
---------

API users will be happy to know that the APIs have been more thoroughly documented in the latest release of H2O and additional capabilities (such as exporting weights and biases for Deep Learning models) have been added.

REST APIs are generated immediately out of the code, allowing users to implement machine learning in many ways. For example, REST APIs could be used to call a model created by sensor data and to set up auto-alerts if the sensor data falls below a specified threshold.

-  `H2O 3 REST API Overview <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/h2o-docs/src/api/REST/h2o_3_rest_api_overview.md>`_: This document describes how the REST API commands are used in H2O, versioning, experimental APIs, verbs, status codes, formats, schemas, payloads, metadata, and examples.

Developers
----------

If you're looking to use H2O to help you develop your own apps, the following links will provide helpful references.

For the latest version of IDEA IntelliJ, run ``./gradlew idea``, then click **File > Open** within IDEA. Select the ``.ipr`` file in the repository and click the **Choose** button.

For older versions of IDEA IntelliJ, run ``./gradlew idea``, then **Import Project** within IDEA and point it to the `h2o-3 directory <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3>`_.

**Note**: This process will take longer, so we recommend using the first method if possible.

For JUnit tests to pass, you may need multiple H2O nodes. Create a "Run/Debug" configuration with the following parameters:

::

    Type: Application
    Main class: H2OApp
    Use class path of module: h2o-app

After starting multiple "worker" node processes in addition to the JUnit test process, they will cloud up and run the multi-node JUnit tests.

**Important Points to Remember**:

-  The command used to launch H2O differs from previous versions. (Refer to the `Walkthrough`_ section.)
-  Launching H2O on Hadoop requires at least 6 GB of memory
-  Each H2O node runs as a mapper
-  Run only one mapper per host
-  There are no combiners or reducers
-  Each H2O cluster must have a unique job name
-  ``-mapperXmx``, ``-nodes``, and ``-output`` are required
-  Root permissions are not required - just unzip the H2O .zip file on any single node

Prerequisite: Open Communication Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

H2O communicates using two communication paths. Verify these are open and available for use by H2O.

**Path 1: mapper to driver**

Optionally specify this port using the ``-driverport`` option in the ``hadoop jar`` command (see "Hadoop Launch Parameters" below). This port is opened on the driver host (the host where you entered the ``hadoop jar`` command). By default, this port is chosen randomly by the operating system. If you don't want to specify an exact port but you still want to restrict the port to a certain range of ports, you can use the option ``-driverportrange``.

**Path 2: mapper to mapper**

Optionally specify this port using the ``-baseport`` option in the ``hadoop jar`` command (refer to `Hadoop Launch Parameters`_ below. This port and the next subsequent port are opened on the mapper hosts (the Hadoop worker nodes) where the H2O mapper nodes are placed by the Resource Manager. By default, ports 54321 and 54322 are used.

The mapper port is adaptive: if 54321 and 54322 are not available, H2O will try 54323 and 54324 and so on. The mapper port is designed to be adaptive because sometimes if the YARN cluster is low on resources, YARN will place two H2O mappers for the same H2O cluster request on the same physical host. For this reason, we recommend opening a range of more than two ports (20 ports should be sufficient).

-----------------------

.. _Walkthrough:

Walkthrough
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following steps show you how to download or build H2O with Hadoop and the parameters involved in launching H2O from the command line.

1. Download the latest H2O release for your version of Hadoop. Refer to the `H2O on Hadoop <http://www.h2o.ai/download>`__ tab of the download page for either the latest stable release or the nightly bleeding edge release.

2. Prepare the job input on the Hadoop Node by unzipping the build file and changing to the directory with the Hadoop and H2O's driver jar files.

   ::

       unzip h2o-{{project_version}}-*.zip
       cd h2o-{{project_version}}-*

3. To launch H2O nodes and form a cluster on the Hadoop cluster, run:

   ::

     hadoop jar h2odriver.jar -nodes 1 -mapperXmx 6g

   The above command launches a 6g node of H2O. We recommend you launch the cluster with at least four times the memory of your data file size.

   -  *mapperXmx* is the mapper size or the amount of memory allocated to each node. Specify at least 6 GB.

   -  *nodes* is the number of nodes requested to form the cluster.

   -  *output* is the name of the directory created each time a H2O cloud is created so it is necessary for the name to be unique each time it is launched.

4. To monitor your job, direct your web browser to your standard job tracker Web UI. To access H2O's Web UI, direct your web browser to one of the launched instances. If you are unsure where your JVM is launched, review the output from your command after the nodes has clouded up and formed a cluster. Any of the nodes' IP addresses will work as there is no master node.

   ::

.. _Hadoop Launch Parameters:

Hadoop Launch Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``-h | -help``: Display help
-  ``-jobname <JobName>``: Specify a job name for the Jobtracker to use; the default is ``H2O_nnnnn`` (where n is chosen randomly)
-  ``-principal <kerberos principal> -keytab <keytab path> | -run_as_user <hadoop username>``: Optionally specify a Kerberos principal and keytab or specify the ``run_as_user`` parameter to start clusters on behalf of the user/principal. Note that using ``run_as_user`` implies that the Hadoop cluster does not have Kerberos. 
-  ``-driverif <IP address of mapper -> driver callback interface>``: Specify the IP address for callback messages from the mapper to the driver.
-  ``-driverport <port of mapper -> callback interface>``: Specify the port number for callback messages from the mapper to the driver.
-  ``-driverportrange <range portX-portY of mapper-> callback interface>``: Specify the allowed port range of the driver callback interface, eg. 50000-55000.
-  ``-network <IPv4Network1>[,<IPv4Network2>]``: Specify the IPv4 network(s) to bind to the H2O nodes; multiple networks can be specified to force H2O to use the specified host in the Hadoop cluster. ``10.1.2.0/24`` allows 256 possibilities.
-  ``-timeout <seconds>``: Specify the timeout duration (in seconds) to wait for the cluster to form before failing. **Note**: The default value is 120 seconds; if your cluster is very busy, this may not provide enough time for the nodes to launch. If H2O does not launch, try increasing this value (for example, ``-timeout 600``).
-  ``-disown``: Exit the driver after the cluster forms.

    **Note**: For Qubole users who include the ``-disown`` flag, if your cluster is dying right after launch, add ``-Dmapred.jobclient.killjob.onexit=false`` as a launch parameter.

-  ``-notify <notification file name>``: Specify a file to write when the cluster is up. The file contains the IP and port of the embedded web server for one of the nodes in the cluster. All mappers must start before the H2O cloud is considered "up".
-  ``-mapperXmx <per mapper Java Xmx heap size>``: Specify the amount of memory to allocate to H2O (at least 6g).
-  ``-extramempercent``: Specify the extra memory for internal JVM use outside of the Java heap. This is a percentage of ``mapperXmx``.
-  ``-n | -nodes <number of H2O nodes>``: Specify the number of nodes.
-  ``-nthreads <maximum number of CPUs>``: Specify the number of CPUs to use. This defaults to using all CPUs on the host, or you can enter a positive integer.
-  ``-baseport <initialization port for H2O nodes>``: Specify the initialization port for the H2O nodes. The default is ``54321``.
-  ``-ea``: Enable assertions to verify boolean expressions for error detection.
-  ``-verbose:gc``: Include heap and garbage collection information in the logs.
-  ``-XX:+PrintGCDetails``: Include a short message after each garbage collection.
-  ``-license <license file name>``: Specify the directory of local filesytem location and the license file name.
-  ``-o | -output <HDFS output directory>``: Specify the HDFS directory for the output.
-  ``-flow_dir <Saved Flows directory>``: Specify the directory for saved flows. By default, H2O will try to find the HDFS home directory to use as the directory for flows. If the HDFS home directory is not found, flows cannot be saved unless a directory is specified using ``-flow_dir``.
-  ``-port_offset <num>``: This parameter allows you to specify the relationship of the API port ("web port") and the internal communication port. The h2o port and API port are derived from each other, and we cannot fully decouple them. Instead, we allow you to specify an offset such that h2o port = api port + offset. This allows you to move the communication port to a specific range that can be firewalled.
-  ``-proxy``: Enables Proxy mode.
-  ``-report_hostname``: This flag allows the user to specify the machine hostname instead of the IP address when launching H2O Flow. This option can only be used when H2O on Hadoop is started in Proxy mode (with ``-proxy``).

Accessing S3 Data from Hadoop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

H2O launched on Hadoop can access S3 Data in addition to to HDFS. To enable access, follow the instructions below.

Edit Hadoop's ``core-site.xml``, then set the ``HADOOP_CONF_DIR`` environment property to the directory containing the ``core-site.xml`` file. For an example ``core-site.xml`` file, refer to :ref:`Core-site.xml`. Typically, the configuration directory for most Hadoop distributions is ``/etc/hadoop/conf``.

You can also pass the S3 credentials when launching H2O with the Hadoop jar command. Use the ``-D`` flag to pass the credentials:

::

        hadoop jar h2odriver.jar -Dfs.s3.awsAccessKeyId="${AWS_ACCESS_KEY}" -Dfs.s3n.awsSecretAccessKey="${AWS_SECRET_KEY}" -n 3 -mapperXmx 10g  -output outputDirectory

where ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY`` represents your user name and ``AWS_SECRET_KEY`` represents your password.

Then import the data with the S3 URL path:

-  To import the data from the Flow API:

   ::

       importFiles [ "s3:/path/to/bucket/file/file.tab.gz" ]

-  To import the data from the R API:

   ::

       h2o.importFile(path = "s3://bucket/path/to/file.csv")

-  To import the data from the Python API:

   ::

       h2o.import_frame(path = "s3://bucket/path/to/file.csv")

YARN Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

YARN (Yet Another Resource Manager) is a resource management framework. H2O can be launched as an application on YARN. If you want to run H2O on Hadoop, essentially, you are running H2O on YARN. If you are not currently using YARN to manage your cluster resources, we strongly recommend it.

Using H2O with YARN
'''''''''''''''''''

When you launch H2O on Hadoop using the ``hadoop jar`` command, YARN allocates the necessary resources to launch the requested number of nodes. H2O launches as a MapReduce (V2) task, where each mapper is an H2O node of the specified size.

``hadoop jar h2odriver.jar -nodes 1 -mapperXmx 6g -output hdfsOutputDirName``

Occasionally, YARN may reject a job request. This usually occurs because either there is not enough memory to launch the job or because of an incorrect configuration.

If YARN rejects the job request, try launching the job with less memory to see if that is the cause of the failure. Specify smaller values for ``-mapperXmx`` (we recommend a minimum of ``2g``) and ``-nodes`` (start with ``1``) to confirm that H2O can launch successfully.

To resolve configuration issues, adjust the maximum memory that YARN will allow when launching each mapper. If the cluster manager settings are configured for the default maximum memory size but the memory required for the request exceeds that amount, YARN will not launch and H2O will time out. If you are using the default configuration, change the configuration settings in your cluster manager to specify memory allocation when launching mapper tasks. To calculate the amount of memory required for a successful launch, use the following formula:

    YARN container size (``mapreduce.map.memory.mb``) = ``-mapperXmx`` value + (``-mapperXmx`` \* ``-extramempercent`` [default is 10%])

The ``mapreduce.map.memory.mb`` value must be less than the YARN memory configuration values for the launch to succeed.

Configuring YARN
''''''''''''''''

**For Cloudera, configure the settings in Cloudera Manager. Depending on how the cluster is configured, you may need to change the settings for more than one role group.**

1. Click **Configuration** and enter the following search term in quotes: **yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb**.

2. Enter the amount of memory (in GB) to allocate in the **Value** field. If more than one group is listed, change the values for all listed groups.

   .. figure:: images/TroubleshootingHadoopClouderayarnnodemgr.png
      :alt: Cloudera Configuration

3. Click the **Save Changes** button in the upper-right corner.

4. Enter the following search term in quotes: **yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb**

5. Change the value, click the **Save Changes** button in the upper-right corner, and redeploy.

  .. figure:: images/TroubleshootingHadoopClouderayarnscheduler.png
     :alt: Cloudera Configuration

**For Hortonworks,**
`configure <http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-1.6.0.0/bk_Monitoring_Hadoop_Book/content/monitor-chap2-3-3_2x.html>`__ **the settings in Ambari.**

1. Select **YARN**, then click the **Configs** tab.

2. Select the group.

3. In the **Node Manager** section, enter the amount of memory (in MB) to allocate in the **yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb** entry field.

  .. figure:: images/TroubleshootingHadoopAmbariNodeMgr.png
     :alt: Ambari Configuration

4. In the **Scheduler** section, enter the amount of memory (in MB) to allocate in the **yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb** entry field.

  .. figure:: images/TroubleshootingHadoopAmbariyarnscheduler.png
     :alt: Ambari Configuration

5. Click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page and redeploy the cluster.

**For MapR:**

1. Edit the **yarn-site.xml** file for the node running the ResourceManager.

2. Change the values for the ``yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb`` and ``yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb`` properties.

3. Restart the ResourceManager and redeploy the cluster.

To verify the values were changed, check the values for the following properties:

::

     - <name>yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb</name>
     - <name>yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb</name>

Limiting CPU Usage
''''''''''''''''''

To limit the number of CPUs used by H2O, use the ``-nthreads`` option and specify the maximum number of CPUs for a single container to use. The following example limits the number of CPUs to four:

``hadoop jar h2odriver.jar -nthreads 4 -nodes 1 -mapperXmx 6g -output hdfsOutputDirName``

**Note**: The default is 4\*the number of CPUs. You must specify at least four CPUs; otherwise, the following error message displays: ``ERROR: nthreads invalid (must be >= 4)``

Specifying Queues
'''''''''''''''''

If you do not specify a queue when launching H2O, H2O jobs are submitted to the default queue. Jobs submitted to the default queue have a lower priority than jobs submitted to a specific queue.

To specify a queue with Hadoop, enter ``-Dmapreduce.job.queuename=<my-h2o-queue>`` (where ``<my-h2o-queue>`` is the name of the queue) when launching Hadoop.

For example,

::

  hadoop jar h2odriver.jar -Dmapreduce.job.queuename=<my-h2o-queue> -nodes <num-nodes> -mapperXmx 6g -output hdfsOutputDirName

Specifying Output Directories
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To prevent overwriting multiple users' files, each job must have a unique output directory name. Change the ``-output hdfsOutputDir`` argument (where ``hdfsOutputDir`` is the name of the directory.

Alternatively, you can delete the directory (manually or by using a script) instead of creating a unique directory each time you launch H2O.

Customizing YARN
''''''''''''''''

Most of the configurable YARN variables are stored in ``yarn-site.xml``. To prevent settings from being overridden, you can mark a config as "final." If you change any values in ``yarn-site.xml``, you must restart YARN to confirm the changes.

Accessing Logs
''''''''''''''

Access logs for a YARN job with the ``yarn logs -applicationId <application_id>`` command from a terminal.  Note that this command must be run by the same userid as the job owner, and only after the job has finished.

How H2O runs on YARN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's say that you have a Hadoop cluster with six worker nodes and six HDFS nodes.
For architectural diagramming purposes, the worker nodes and HDFS nodes are shown as separate blocks in the block diagram,
but they may actually be running on the same physical machines.
The ``hadoop jar`` command that you run on the edge node talks to the YARN Resource Manager to launch an H2O MRv2 (MapReduce v2) job.
The Resource Manager places the requested number of H2O nodes (aka MRv2 mappers, aka YARN containers) -- three in this example -- on worker nodes.
See the picture below:

  .. figure:: images/h2o-on-yarn-1.png

Once the H2O job's nodes all start, they find each other and create an H2O cluster (as shown by the dark blue line encircling the three H2O nodes).
The three H2O nodes work together to perform distributed Machine Learning functions as a group, as shown below.

Note how the three worker nodes that are not part of the H2O job have been removed from the picture below for explanatory purposes.
They aren't part of the compute and memory resources used by the H2O job.
The full complement of HDFS is still available, however:

  .. figure:: images/h2o-on-yarn-2.png

Data is then read in from HDFS *once* (as shown by the red lines), and stored as distributed H2O Frames in H2O's in-memory column-compressed Distributed Key/Value (DKV) store.  See the picture below:

  .. figure:: images/h2o-on-yarn-3.png

Machine Learning algorithms can then run very fast in a parallel and distributed way (as shown by the light blue lines).
They iteratively sweep over the data over and over again to build models, which is why the in-memory storage makes H2O fast.

Note how the HDFS nodes have been removed from the picture below for explanatory purposes, to emphasize that the data lives in memory during the model training process:

  .. figure:: images/h2o-on-yarn-4.png


Docker Users
------------

This section describes how to use H2O on Docker and walks you through the followings steps:

-  Installing Docker on Mac or Linux OS
-  Creating and modifying the Dockerfile
-  Building a Docker image from the Dockerfile
-  Running the Docker build
-  Launching H2O
-  Accessing H2O from the web browser or from R/Python

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Linux kernel version 3.8+ or Mac OS X 10.6+
-  VirtualBox
-  Latest version of Docker is installed and configured
-  Docker daemon is running - enter all commands below in the Docker
   daemon window
-  Using ``User`` directory (not ``root``)

**Notes**:

-  Older Linux kernel versions are known to cause kernel panics that break Docker. There are ways around it, but these should be attempted at your own risk. To check the version of your kernel, run ``uname -r`` at the command prompt. The walkthrough that follows has been tested on a Mac OS X 10.10.1.
-  The Dockerfile always pulls the latest H2O release.
-  The Docker image only needs to be built once.

Walkthrough
~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step 1 - Install and Launch Docker**

Depending on your OS, select the appropriate installation method:

-  `Mac
   Installation <https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/#installation>`__. **Note**: By default, Docker allocates 2GB of memory for Mac installations. Be sure to increase this value. We normally suggest 3-4 times the size of the dataset for the amount of memory required.     
-  `Ubuntu
   Installation <https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/>`__
-  `Other OS Installations <https://docs.docker.com/installation/>`__

**Step 2 - Create or Download Dockerfile**

**Note**: If the following commands do not work, prepend them with ``sudo``.

1. Create a folder on the Host OS to host your Dockerfile by running:

.. todo:: figure out if branch_name is getting replaced with the actual branch_name or how to set that up

  ::

      mkdir -p /data/h2o-{{branch_name}}

2. Next, either download or create a Dockerfile, which is a build recipe that builds the container.

  Download and use our `Dockerfile template <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/blob/master/Dockerfile>`__ by running:

  ::

      cd /data/h2o-{{branch_name}}
      wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h2oai/h2o-3/master/Dockerfile

  The Dockerfile:

    -  obtains and updates the base image (Ubuntu 14.04)
    -  installs Java 7
    -  obtains and downloads the H2O build from H2O's S3 repository
    -  exposes ports 54321 and 54322 in preparation for launching H2O on those ports

**Step 3 - Build Docker image from Dockerfile**

From the **/data/h2o-{{branch\_name}}** directory, run the following. Note below that ``v5`` represents the current version number.

::

    docker build -t "h2o.ai/{{branch_name}}:v5" .

Because it assembles all the necessary parts for the image, this process can take a few minutes.

**Step 4 - Run Docker Build**

On a Mac, use the argument ``-p 54321:54321`` to expressly map the port 54321. This is not necessary on Linux. Note below that ``v5`` represents the version number.

::

    docker run -ti -p 54321:54321 h2o.ai/{{branch_name}}:v5 /bin/bash

**Step 5 - Launch H2O**

Navigate to the ``/opt`` directory and launch H2O. Change the value of ``-Xmx`` to the amount of memory you want to allocate to the H2O instance. By default, H2O launches on port 54321. 

::

    cd /opt
    java -Xmx1g -jar h2o.jar

**Step 6 - Access H2O from the web browser or R**

-  **On Linux**: After H2O launches, copy and paste the IP address and port of the H2O instance into the address bar of your browser. In the following example, the IP is ``172.17.0.5:54321``.

  ::

     03:58:25.963 main      INFO WATER: Cloud of size 1 formed [/172.17.0.5:54321 (00:00:00.000)]

-  **On OSX**: Locate the IP address of the Docker's network (``192.168.59.103`` in the following examples) that bridges to your Host OS by opening a new Terminal window (not a bash for your container) and running ``boot2docker ip``.

  ::

     $ boot2docker ip
     192.168.59.103

You can also view the IP address (``192.168.99.100`` in the example below) by scrolling to the top of the Docker daemon window:

::


                            ##         .
                      ## ## ##        ==
                   ## ## ## ## ##    ===
               /"""""""""""""""""\___/ ===
          ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
               \______ o           __/
                 \    \         __/
                  \____\_______/


    docker is configured to use the default machine with IP 192.168.99.100
    For help getting started, check out the docs at https://docs.docker.com

After obtaining the IP address, point your browser to the specified ip address and port to open Flow. In R and Python, you can access the instance by installing the latest version of the H2O R or Python package and then initializing H2O:


  .. example-code::
     .. code-block:: r

      # Initialize H2O
      library(h2o)
      dockerH2O <- h2o.init(ip = "192.168.59.103", port = 54321)

     .. code-block:: python

      # Initialize H2O 
      import h2o
      docker_h2o = h2o.init(ip = "192.168.59.103", port = 54321)
