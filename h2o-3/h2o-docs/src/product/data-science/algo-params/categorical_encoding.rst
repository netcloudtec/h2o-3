``categorical_encoding``
------------------------

- Available in: GBM, DRF, Deep Learning, K-Means, Aggregator, XGBoost
- Hyperparameter: yes

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This option specifies the encoding scheme to use for handling categorical features. Available schemes include the following:

**GBM/DRF**

  - ``auto`` or ``AUTO``: Allow the algorithm to decide (default). For GBM and DRF, the algorithm will perform Enum encoding when ``auto`` option is specified. 
  - ``enum`` or ``Enum``: Leave the dataset as is, internally map the strings to integers, and use these integers to make splits - either via ordinal nature when ``nbins_cats`` is too small to resolve all levels or via bitsets that do a perfect group split. Each category is a separate category; its name (or number) is irrelevant. For example, after the strings are mapped to integers for Enum, you can split {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as {0, 4, 5} and {1, 2, 3}.
  - ``enum_limited`` or ``EnumLimited``: Automatically reduce categorical levels to the most prevalent ones during Aggregator training and only keep the **T** most frequent levels.
  - ``one_hot_explicit`` or ``OneHotExplicit``: N+1 new columns for categorical features with N levels
  - ``binary`` or ``Binary``: No more than 32 columns per categorical feature
  - ``eigen`` or ``Eigen``: *k* columns per categorical feature, keeping projections of one-hot-encoded matrix onto *k*-dim eigen space only
  - ``label_encoder`` or ``LabelEncoder``: Convert every enum into the integer of its index (for example, level 0 -> 0, level 1 -> 1, etc.) The categories are lexicographically mapped to numbers and lose their categorical nature, becoming ordinal. After the strings are mapped to integers, you can split {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as {0, 1, 2} and {3, 4, 5}.
  - ``sort_by_response`` or ``SortByResponse``: Reorders the levels by the mean response (for example, the level with lowest response -> 0, the level with second-lowest response -> 1, etc.). This is useful in GBM/DRF, for example, when you have more levels than ``nbins_cats``, and where the top level splits now have a chance at separating the data with a split. Note that this requires a specified response column.

**Deep Learning**

  - ``auto`` or ``AUTO``:  Allow the algorithm to decide. For Deep Learning, the algorithm will perform One Hot Internal encoding when ``auto`` is specified.
  - ``one_hot_internal`` or ``OneHotInternal``: Leave the dataset as is. This internally expands each row via one-hot encoding on the fly. (default)
  - ``binary`` or ``Binary``: No more than 32 columns per categorical feature
  - ``eigen`` or ``Eigen``: *k* columns per categorical feature, keeping projections of one-hot-encoded matrix onto *k*-dim eigen space only
  - ``label_encoder`` or ``LabelEncoder``: Convert every enum into the integer of its index (for example, level 0 -> 0, level 1 -> 1, etc.). The categories are lexicographically mapped to numbers and lose their categorical nature, becoming ordinal. After the strings are mapped to integers, you can split {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as {0, 1, 2} and {3, 4, 5}. This is useful for keeping the number of columns small for XGBoost or DeepLearning, where the algorithm otherwise perform ExplicitOneHotEncoding. 
  - ``sort_by_response`` or ``SortByResponse``: Reorders the levels by the mean response (for example, the level with lowest response -> 0, the level with second-lowest response -> 1, etc.). Note that this requires a specified response column.

  **Note**: For Deep Learning, this value defaults to ``one_hot_internal``. Similarly, if ``auto`` is specified, then the algorithm performs ``one_hot_internal`` encoding. 

**Aggregator**

  - ``auto`` or ``AUTO``:  Allow the algorithm to decide. For Aggregator, the algorithm will perform One Hot Internal encoding when ``auto`` is specified.
  - ``one_hot_internal`` or ``OneHotInternal``: Leave the dataset as is. This internally expands each row via one-hot encoding on the fly. (default)
  - ``binary`` or ``Binary``: No more than 32 columns per categorical feature
  - ``eigen`` or ``Eigen``: *k* columns per categorical feature, keeping projections of one-hot-encoded matrix onto *k*-dim eigen space only
  - ``label_encoder`` or ``LabelEncoder``: Convert every enum into the integer of its index (for example, level 0 -> 0, level 1 -> 1, etc.). The categories are lexicographically mapped to numbers and lose their categorical nature, becoming ordinal. After the strings are mapped to integers, you can split {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as {0, 1, 2} and {3, 4, 5}. This is useful for keeping the number of columns small. 
  - ``enum_limited`` or ``EnumLimited``: Automatically reduce categorical levels to the most prevalent ones during Aggregator training and only keep the **T** most frequent levels.

**XGBoost**

  - ``auto`` or ``AUTO``: Allow the algorithm to decide (default). In XGBoost, the algorithm will automatically perform ``enum`` encoding. (default)
  - ``enum`` or ``Enum``: 1 column per categorical feature. Each category is a separate category; its name (or number) is irrelevant. For example, after the strings are mapped to integers for Enum, you can split {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as {0, 4, 5} and {1, 2, 3}.
  - ``one_hot_internal`` or ``OneHotInternal``: On the fly N+1 new cols for categorical features with N levels
  - ``one_hot_explicit`` or ``OneHotExplicit``: N+1 new columns for categorical features with N levels
  - ``binary``: No more than 32 columns per categorical feature
  - ``eigen`` or ``Eigen``: *k* columns per categorical feature, keeping projections of one-hot-encoded matrix onto *k*-dim eigen space only
  - ``label_encoder`` or ``LabelEncoder``: Convert every enum into the integer of its index (for example, level 0 -> 0, level 1 -> 1, etc.) The categories are lexicographically mapped to numbers and lose their categorical nature, becoming ordinal. After the strings are mapped to integers, you can split {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as {0, 1, 2} and {3, 4, 5}. 
  - ``sort_by_response`` or ``SortByResponse``: Reorders the levels by the mean response (for example, the level with lowest response -> 0, the level with second-lowest response -> 1, etc.). This is useful, for example, when you have more levels than ``nbins_cats``, and where the top level splits now have a chance at separating the data with a split. Note that this requires a specified response column.
  - ``enum_limited`` or ``EnumLimited``: Automatically reduce categorical levels to the most prevalent ones during training and only keep the **T** most frequent levels.

**K-Means**

  - ``auto`` or ``AUTO``: Allow the algorithm to decide (default). For K-Means, the algorithm will perform Enum encoding when ``auto`` option is specified. 
  - ``enum`` or ``Enum``: Leave the dataset as is, internally map the strings to integers, and use these integers to make splits - either via ordinal nature when ``nbins_cats`` is too small to resolve all levels or via bitsets that do a perfect group split. Each category is a separate category; its name (or number) is irrelevant. For example, after the strings are mapped to integers for Enum, you can split {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as {0, 4, 5} and {1, 2, 3}.
  - ``one_hot_explicit`` or ``OneHotExplicit``: N+1 new columns for categorical features with N levels
  - ``binary`` or ``Binary``: No more than 32 columns per categorical feature
  - ``eigen`` or ``Eigen``: *k* columns per categorical feature, keeping projections of one-hot-encoded matrix onto *k*-dim eigen space only

After the strings are mapped to integers, you can split {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} as {0, 1, 2} and {3, 4, 5}.
