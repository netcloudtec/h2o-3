.. _early_stopping:

``early_stopping``
------------------

- Available in: GLM
- Hyperparameter: no

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``early_stopping`` option specifies whether to stop early when there is no more relative improvement on the training or validation (if provided) set. This option prevents expensive model building with many predictors when no more improvements are occurring. This option is enabled by default. 

Related Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None
