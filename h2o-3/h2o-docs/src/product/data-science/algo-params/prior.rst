``prior``
---------

- Available in: GLM
- Hyperparameter: no

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This option specifies the prior probability of class 1 in the response when ``family = "binomial"``.  The default value is the observation frequency of class 1. This must be a value from (0,1) exclusive range, and defaults to -1 (no prior). This parameter is useful for logistic regression if the data has been sampled and the mean of response does not reflect reality.

- none
