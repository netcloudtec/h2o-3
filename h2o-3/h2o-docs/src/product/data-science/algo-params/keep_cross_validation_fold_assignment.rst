``keep_cross_validation_fold_assignment``
-----------------------------------------

- Available in: GBM, DRF, Deep Learning, GLM, Na√Øve-Bayes, K-Means, XGBoost
- Hyperparameter: no

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

When performing cross-validation, data is split into subsets using either the ``fold_column`` or ``fold_assignment`` parameter. You can then specify to save each of the outputted fold assignments by enabling the ``keep_cross_validation_fold_assignment`` option. Note that this option is disabled by default.

More information about cross-validation is available in the `Cross-Validation <../../cross-validation.html>`__ section.

	cars.split <- h2o.splitFrame(data = cars,ratios = 0.8, seed = 1234)
