\section{Introduction}

This documentation describes how to use H2O in the R environment. More information on H2O's system and algorithms (as well as R user documentation) is available at the H2O website at {\url{http://docs.h2o.ai}}.

R uses a REST API to connect to H2O. To use H2O in R or launch H2O from R, specify the IP address and port number of the H2O instance in the R environment . Datasets are not directly transmitted through the REST API. Instead, commands (for example, importing a dataset at specified HDFS location) are sent either through the browser or the REST API to perform the specified task.

The dataset is then assigned an identifier (the .hex file type in H2O) used as a reference in  commands to the web server. After preparing the dataset for modeling by defining significant data and removing insignificant data, H2O creates a model that represents the results of the data analysis. These models are assigned IDs used as references in commands. One of the most popular models for data analysis is GLM.

GLM estimates regression models for outcomes following exponential distributions in general. In addition to the Gaussian (i.e. normal) distribution, these include binomial, gamma, Poisson, and Tweedie distributions. Each serves a different purpose, and depending on distribution and link function, can be used for prediction or classification.

This booklet demonstrates H2O's implementation of GLM in an R environment. For more information on GLM, refer to \textbf{Generalized Linear Modeling with H2O} at {\url{http://h2o.ai/resources/}}.

H2O supports Spark, YARN, and most versions of Hadoop. Hadoop is a scalable open-source file system that uses clusters for distributed storage and dataset processing. Depending on the size of your data, H2O can run on your desktop or scale using multiple nodes with Hadoop, an EC2 cluster, or S3 storage.

H2O nodes run as JVM invocations on Hadoop nodes. For performance reasons, we recommend that you do not run an H2O node on the same hardware as the Hadoop NameNode. Because H2O nodes run as mapper tasks in Hadoop, administrators can view them in the normal JobTracker and TaskTracker frameworks, providing process-level (i.e. JVM instance-level) visibility.

H2O helps R users make the leap from laptop-based processing to large-scale environments. Hadoop lets H2O users scale their data processing capabilities based on their current needs. Using H2O, R, and Hadoop, you can create a complete end-to-end data analysis solution.

This document describes the four steps of data analysis with H2O:
\begin{enumerate}

\item installing H2O
\item preparing your data for modeling (data munging)
\item creating a model using simple but powerful machine learning algorithms
\item scoring your models

\end{enumerate}

\input{common/what_is_h2o.tex}


\section{Installation}
H2O requires Java; if you do not already have Java installed, install it from {\url{https://java.com/en/download/}} before installing H2O.

To use H2O with R, start H2O outside of R and connect to it, or launch H2O from R. However, if you launch H2O from R and close the R session, the H2O session closes as well. The H2O session directs R to the datasets and models located in H2O.

This following sections describe:

\begin{itemize}
\item installing R
\item installing H2O from R
%\item making a build from source code
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installing R}

To download R:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to \url{http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html}.
\item Select your closest local mirror.
\item Select your operating system (Linux, OS X, or Windows).
\item Depending on your OS, download the appropriate file, along with any required packages.
\item When the download is complete, unzip the file and install. \\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Installing H2O from R}

To load a recent H2O package from CRAN, run:

\waterExampleInR
\medskip
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_install_package.R}

{\bf{Note}}: The version of H2O in CRAN is often one release behind the current version.

For the latest recommended version, download the
latest stable H2O-3 build from the H2O download page:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Go to {\url{http://h2o.ai/download}}.
\item Choose the latest stable H2O-3 build.
\item Click the ``Install in R'' tab.
\item Copy and paste the commands into your R session.
\end{enumerate}


After H2O is installed on your system, verify the installation completed successfully by initializing H2O:

\subsection{Example Code}

R code for the examples in this document is located here:

\url{http://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/h2o-docs/src/booklets/v2_2015/source/R_Vignette_code_examples}

\section{H2O Initialization}

This section describes how to launch H2O:
\begin{itemize}
\item from R
\item from the command line
\item on Hadoop
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Launching from R} \label{ssec:LaunchR}

To specify the number of CPUs for the H2O session, use the \texttt{nthreads = } parameter in the \texttt{h2o.init} command. \texttt{-2} uses the CRAN default of 2 CPUs. \texttt{-1} uses
all CPUs on the host, which is strongly recommended. To use a specific number of CPUs, enter a positive integer.

To specify the maximum amount of memory for the H2O session, use the {\texttt{max\_mem\_size}} parameter in the \texttt{h2o.init} command. The value must a multiple of 1024 greater than 2MB. Append the letter \texttt{m} or \texttt{M} to indicate megabytes, or \texttt{g} or \texttt{G} to indicate gigabytes.

If you do not specify a value for {\texttt{max\_mem\_size}} when you run {\texttt{h2o.init}}, the default heap size of the H2O instance running on 32-bit Java is 1g.

For best performance, the allocated memory should be 4x the size of your data, but never more than the total amount of memory on your computer. For larger datasets, we recommend running on a server or service with more memory available for computing.

H2O checks the Java version and suggests an upgrade if you are running 32-bit Java. On 64-bit Java, the heap size is 1/4 of the total memory available on the machine.

To launch H2O locally from R, run the following in R:

\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_start_local.R}

After successfully launching, R displays output similar to the following example:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=R]
Successfully connected to http://localhost:54321
R is connected to H2O cluster:
   H2O cluster uptime:         11 minutes 35 seconds
   H2O cluster version:        2.7.0.1497
   H2O cluster name:           H2O_started_from_R
   H2O cluster total nodes:    1
   H2O cluster total memory:   3.56 GB
   H2O cluster total cores:    8
   H2O cluster allowed cores:  8
   H2O cluster healthy:        TRUE
\end{lstlisting}


To launch H2O locally with default initialization arguments, use the following:

\waterExampleInR
\medskip
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_init_default.R}

\newpage

To connect to an established H2O cluster (in a multi-node Hadoop environment, for example) specify the IP address and port number for the established cluster using the \texttt{ip} and \texttt{port} parameters in the \texttt{h2o.init()} command.

\waterExampleInR
\medskip
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_connect_existing.R}

\subsection{Launching from the Command Line}

A simple way to launch H2O from the command line is to download the H2O zip file from the H2O download page. Unzip and
launch H2O with the following:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=R]
unzip h2o-3.5.0.1-*.zip
cd h2o-3.5.0.1-*
java -jar h2o.jar
\end{lstlisting}
See the H2O Documentation for additional JVM and H2O command line options.
After launching the H2O instance, connect to it from R with {\texttt{h2o.init()}} as described above.

\subsection{Launching on Hadoop}

To launch H2O nodes and form a cluster on the Hadoop cluster, run:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=R]
hadoop jar h2odriver.jar -nodes 1 -mapperXmx 6g -output hdfsOutputDirName

\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\item You must launch the Hadoop-specific H2O driver jar (\texttt{h2odriver.jar}) for your Hadoop distribution. Specific driver jar files are available for the following Hadoop versions:

\begin{frame}%no line table for list of 6+ items

\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}p{3cm}p{3cm}}

\begin{itemize}
     \item \texttt{cdh5.2}
     \item \texttt{cdh5.3}
     \item \texttt{cdh5.4}
     \item \texttt{cdh5.5}
     \item \texttt{cdh5.6}
     \item \texttt{cdh5.7}
     \item \texttt{cdh5.8}
  \end{itemize} &

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{hdp2.1}
  \item  \texttt{hdp2.2}
  \item  \texttt{hdp2.3}
  \item  \texttt{hdp2.4}
  \item  \texttt{hdp2.5}
\end{itemize} &

\begin{itemize}
  \item  \texttt{mapr4.0}
  \item  \texttt{mapr5.0}
  \item  \texttt{mapr5.1}
\end{itemize}\\

\end{tabular}

\end{frame}

\item The above command launches exactly one 6g node of H2O; however,  we recommend launching the cluster with 4 times the memory of your data file.
\item{\texttt{mapperXmx}} is the mapper size or the amount of memory allocated to each node.
\item{\texttt{nodes}} is the number of nodes requested to form the cluster.
\item{\texttt{output}} is the name of the directory created each time a H2O cloud is created so it is necessary for the name to be unique each time it is launched.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Checking Cluster Status}


To check the status and health of the H2O cluster, use {\texttt{h2o.clusterInfo()}}.

\waterExampleInR
\medskip
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_cluster_info.R}


An easy-to-read summary of information about the cluster displays.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=R]

R is connected to H2O cluster:
  H2O cluster uptime:         43 minutes 43 seconds
  H2O cluster version:        2.7.0.1497
  H2O cluster name:           H2O_started_from_R
  H2O cluster total nodes:    1
  H2O cluster total memory:   3.56 GB
  H2O cluster total cores:    8
  H2O cluster allowed cores:  8
  H2O cluster healthy:        TRUE

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Data Preparation in R}

The following section contains information about data preparation (also known as data munging) and some of the tools and methods available in H2O, as well as a data training example.

\subsection{Notes}
\begin{itemize}

\item Although it may seem like you are manipulating the data in R, once the data has been passed to H2O, all data munging occurs in the H2O instance. The information is passed to R through JSON APIs, so some functions may not have another method.
\item You are limited by the total amount of memory allocated to the H2O instance, not by R's ability to handle data. To process large datasets, make sure to allocate enough memory. For more information, refer to {\textbf{\nameref{ssec:LaunchR}}}.
\item You can manipulate datasets with thousands of factor levels using H2O in R, so if you ask H2O to display a table in R with information from high cardinality factors, the results may overwhelm R`s capacity.
\item To manipulate data in R and not in H2O, use {\texttt{as.data.frame()}}, {\texttt{as.h2o()}}, and {\texttt{str()}}. \begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{as.data.frame()}} converts an H2O data frame into an R data frame. If your request exceeds the amount of data supported by R, the R session will crash. If possible, we recommend only taking subsets of the entire dataset (the necessary data columns or rows) instead of the whole dataset.
\item {\texttt{as.h2o()}} transfers data from R to the H2O instance. For successful data transfer, we recommend confirming enough memory is allocated to the H2O instance.
\item {\texttt{str.H2OFrame()}} returns the elements of the new object to confirm that the data transferred correctly. It$'$s a good way to verify there were no data loss or conversion issues. %% is this still supported? can't find it in the R package doc...
%%TODO - replaced with possible new command; confirm (JL)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%TODO: still ok? if so, add to common

%\subsection{Tools and Methods}

%The following section describes some of the tools and methods available in H2O for data preparation.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item {\textbf{Data Profiling}}: Quickly summarize the shape of your dataset to avoid bias or missing information before you start building your model. Missing data, zero values, text, and a visual distribution of the data are visualized automatically upon data ingestion.
%\item {\textbf{Summary Statistics}}: Visualize your data with summary statistics to get the mean, standard deviation, min, max, or quantile (for numeric columns) or cardinality and counts (for enum columns), and a preview of the dataset.
%\item {\textbf{Aggregate, Filter, Bin, and Derive Columns}}: Build unique views with Group functions, Filtering, Binning, and Derived Columns.
%\item {\textbf{Slice, Log Transform, and Anonymize}}: Normalize and partition to get your data into the right shape for modeling, and anonymize to remove confidential information.
%\item {\textbf{Variable Creation}}: Highly customizable variable value creation to hone in on the key data characteristics to model.
%\item {\textbf{PCA}}: Principal Component Analysis makes feature selection easy with a simple interface and standard input values to reduce the many dimensions in your dataset into key components.
%\item {\textbf{Training and Validation Sampling Plan}}: Design a random or stratified sampling plan to generate datasets for model training and scoring.
%\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Demo: Creating Aggregates from Split Data}
%[Commenting out - I thought `ddply` was not advisable & had been removed? - JL]

%The following section depicts an example of creating aggregates for data training using {\texttt{ddply()}}. Using this method, you can split your dataset and apply a function to the subsets.

%\waterExampleInR
%To apply a user-specified function to each subset of an H2O dataset and combine the results, use {\texttt{ddply()}}, with the name of the H2O object, the variable name, and the function in the parentheses.
%\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_ddply.R}

\newpage
\section{Models}
%TODO: Another candidate for "common"

The following section describes the features and functions of some common models available in H2O.  For more information about running these models in R using H2O, refer to {\textbf{\nameref{sec:RunModel}}}.

%%mal H2O supports the following models: Deep Learning (DL), Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Na\"{i}ve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), K-Means, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Generalized Low Rank Model (GLRM).

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
H2O supports the following models:


\begin{frame}%no line table for list of 6+ items

\begin{tabular}{p{5.0cm}p{6.0cm}}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Deep Learning
  \item Na\"{i}ve Bayes
  \item Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
  \item K-means
  \item Stacked Ensembles
\end{itemize} &

\begin{itemize}
  \item Generalized Linear Models (GLM) 
  \item Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
  \item Generalized Low Rank Model (GLRM)
  \item Distributed Random Forest (DRF)
  \item Word2vec
\end{itemize}

\end{tabular}

\end{frame}
\end{minipage}

The list is growing quickly, so check \url{www.h2o.ai} to see the latest additions. The following list describes some common model types and features.

\subsection{Supervised Learning}

{\textbf{Generalized Linear Models (GLM)}}: Provides flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression for response variables with error distribution models other than a Gaussian (normal) distribution. GLM unifies various other statistical models, including Poisson, linear, logistic, and others when using $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ regularization.

%%mal {\textbf{Decision trees}}: Used in RF; a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or model of decisions and their possible consequences.
{\textbf{Distributed Random Forest (DRF)}}: Averages multiple decision trees, each created on different random samples of rows and columns. It is easy to use, non-linear, and provides feedback on the importance of each predictor in the model, making it one of the most robust algorithms for noisy data.

{\textbf{Gradient Boosting (GBM)}}: Produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion and is generalized by allowing an arbitrary differentiable loss function. It is one of the most powerful methods available today.

{\textbf{Deep Learning}}: Models high-level abstractions in data by using non-linear transformations in a layer-by-layer method. Deep learning is an example of supervised learning, which can use unlabeled data that other algorithms cannot.

{\textbf{Na\"{i}ve Bayes}}: Generates a probabilistic classifier that assumes the value of a particular feature is unrelated to the presence or absence of any other feature, given the class variable. It is often used in text categorization.

{\textbf{Stacked Ensembles}}: Using multiple models built from different algorithms, Stacked Ensembles finds the optimal combination of a collection of prediction algorithms using a process known as "stacking."

{\textbf{XGBoost}}: XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting library that implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) framework. For many problems, XGBoost is the one of the best GBM frameworks today.  In other cases, the H2O GBM algorithm comes out on top.  Both implementations are available on the H2O platform.

\subsection{Unsupervised Learning}

{\textbf{K-means}}: Reveals groups or clusters of data points for segmentation. It clusters observations into $k$-number of points with the nearest mean.

{\textbf{Anomaly Detection}}: Identifies the outliers in your data by invoking the deep learning autoencoder, a powerful pattern recognition model.

\subsection{Miscellaneous}
{\textbf{Word2vec}}: Takes a text corpus as an input and produces the word vectors as output. The result is an H2O Word2vec model that can be exported as a binary model or as a MOJO.


\subsection{Modeling Constructs}

{\textbf{Grid Search}}: Performs standard hyper-parameter optimization to simplify model configuration.

After creating a model, use it to make predictions. For more information about predictions, refer to {\textbf{\nameref{ssec:Predictions}}}.

%%mal: this feels too lengthy for a modeling example here; perhaps it would be better to have entire work flows at the end?

\section{Demo: GLM}

The following demo demonstrates how to:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Import a file
\item Define significant data
\item View data
\item Create testing and training sets using sampling
\item Define the model
\item Display the results
\end{enumerate}

\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_glm_demo.R}

\newpage
\section{Data Manipulation in R}

The following section describes some common R commands. For a complete command list, including parameters, refer to {\url{http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/latest_stable_Rdoc.html}}.

For additional help within R's Help tab, precede the command with a question mark (for example, {\texttt{?h2o}}) for suggested commands containing the search terms. For more information on a command, precede the command with two question marks ({\texttt{??h2o}}).

\subsection{Importing Files}

The H2O package consolidates all of the various supported import functions using {\texttt{h2o.importFile()}}. % {\texttt{h2o.importFolder}} and {\texttt{h2o.importHDFS}} still work, these functions are deprecated and should be updated to {\texttt{h2o.importFile()}}.
There are a few ways to import files shown in the following examples:

\waterExampleInR
\medskip
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_import_file.R}

\subsection{Uploading Files}

To upload a file in a directory local or remote to your H2O cluster, use {\texttt{h2o.importFile()}}, which is a parallel/distributed read of the data (this is the recommended option).  This requires the data to be visible to all H2O nodes in a multi-node cluster. {\texttt{h2o.uploadFile()}} uploads data local to your H2O cluster as well as uploading data local to your R session. The data only needs to be on the client machine (rather than all the nodes on the H2O cluster), and the upload is single threaded. In the parentheses, specify the H2O reference object in R and the complete URL or normalized file path for the file.


\waterExampleInR
\medskip
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_upload_file.R}


\subsection{Finding Factors}
To determine if any column contains categorical data (also known as a factor), use {\texttt{h2o.anyFactor()}}, with the R reference object in the parentheses.

\waterExampleInR
\medskip
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_factors.R}

\subsection{Converting to Factors}
To convert an integer into a non-ordered factor (also called an enum or categorical), use {\texttt{as.factor()}} with the name of the R reference object in parentheses, followed by the number of the column to convert in brackets.

\waterExampleInR
\medskip
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_to_factors.R}

\subsection{Converting Data Frames}

To convert an H2O parsed data object into an R data frame that can be manipulated using R commands, use {\texttt{as.data.frame()}} with the name of the R reference object in the parentheses.
{\textbf{Caution}}: While this can be very useful, be careful when using this command to convert H2O parsed data objects. H2O can easily handle datasets that are often too large to be handled equivalently well in R.

\waterExampleInR
\medskip
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_as_data_frame.R}

\subsection{Transferring Data Frames}
To transfer a data frame from the R environment to the H2O instance, use  {\texttt{as.h2o()}}. In the parentheses, specify the object in the R environment to convert to an H2O object. Optionally, include the name of the destination frame in H2O. Precede the destination frame name with {\texttt{destination\_frame = }} and enclose the name in quotes as in the following example.

\waterExampleInR
\medskip
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_as_h2o.R}


\subsection{Renaming Data Frames}
To rename a dataframe on the server running H2O for a dataset manipulated in R, use {\texttt{h2o.assign()}}. In the following example, the prostate dataset was uploaded to the H2O instance and the data was manipulated to remove outliers. {\texttt{h2o.assign()}} saves the new dataset on the H2O server so it can be analyzed using H2O without overwriting the original dataset.

\waterExampleInR
\medskip
\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_assign.R}

\subsection{Viewing Column Names}
To view a list of the column names in the dataset, use {\texttt{colnames()}} or {\texttt{names()}} with the name of the R reference object in the parentheses.
\newpage
\waterExampleInR
\medskip
%\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_colnames.R} - This example seems less helpful than the original  - restoring old version for now

\begin{lstlisting}[style=R]
##Displays the titles of the columns
> colnames(iris.hex)
[1] "Sepal.Length" "Sepal.Width"  "Petal.Length" "Petal.Width"  "Species"
> names(iris.hex)
[1] "Sepal.Length" "Sepal.Width"  "Petal.Length" "Petal.Width"  "Species"
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Getting Minimum and Maximum Values}

To view the maximum values for the real-valued columns in a dataset, use {\texttt{max()}} with the name of the R reference object in the parentheses.
To obtain the minimum values for the real-valued columns in a dataset, use {\texttt{min()}} with the name of the R reference object in the parentheses.

\waterExampleInR
\medskip
%\lstinputlisting[style=R]{R_Vignette_code_examples/r_min_max.R} This example seems less helpful than the original  - restoring old version for now

\begin{lstlisting}[style=R]
> min(prostate.hex$AGE)
[1] 43
> max(prostate.hex$AGE)
[1] 79
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Getting Quantiles}

To request quantiles for an H2O parsed dataset, use {\texttt{quantile()}} with the name of the R reference object in the parentheses.

Use  {\texttt{quantile(ReferenceObject\$ColumnName)}},  where {\texttt{ReferenceObject}} represents the R reference object name and \\{\texttt{ColumnName}} represents the name of the specified column to request a quantile for a single numerical column.

When you request quantiles for a full parsed dataset consisting of a single column, {\texttt{quantile()}} displays a matrix with quantile information for the dataset.

\subsection{Summarizing Data}

To generate a summary similar to the one in R for each of the columns in the dataset, use {\texttt{summary()}} with the name of the R reference object in the parentheses.

For continuous real functions, this produces a summary that includes information on quartiles, min, max, and mean.
For factors, this produces information about counts of elements within each factor level.

\subsection{Summarizing Data in a Table}


To summarize data, use {\texttt{h2o.table()}}. Because H2O can handle larger datasets, it is possible to generate tables that are larger than R`s capacity, so use caution when executing this command.
To summarize multiple columns, use {\texttt{head(h2o.table (ObjectName[, c(ColumnNumber,ColumnNumber)]))}}, where {\texttt{ObjectName}} is the name of the object in R and {\texttt{ColumnNumber}} is the number of the column.

\subsection{Generating Random Numbers}

To append a column of random numbers to an H2O data frame for testing/training data splits that are used for analysis and validation in H2O, use {\texttt{h2o.runif()}} with the name of the R reference object in the parentheses. This method is best for customized frame splitting; otherwise, use {\texttt{h2o.splitFrame()}}. However, {\texttt{h2o.runif()}} is not as fast or stable as {\texttt{h2o.splitFrame()}}.

\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Splitting Frames}


To generate two subsets (according to specified ratios) from an existing H2O dataset for testing/training, use {\texttt{h2o.splitFrame()}}, which returns contiguous sections of the data without random sampling.

{\bf{Note}}: {\texttt{h2o.splitFrame()}} does not give an exact split. H2O is designed to be efficient on big data using a probabilistic splitting method rather than an exact split. For example specifying a split of 0.75/0.25, H2O will produce a test/train split with an expected value of 0.75/0.25 rather than exactly 0.75/0.25. On small datasets, the sizes of the resulting splits will deviate from the expected value more than on big data, where they will be very close to exact.

\subsection{Getting Frames}


To create a reference object to the data frame in H2O, use {\texttt{h2o.getFrame()}}. This is helpful for  switching between the web UI and the R API or for multiple users accessing the same H2O instance. The following example assumes prostate.hex is in the key-value (KV) store.

\subsection{Getting Models}


To create a reference object for the model in H2O, use {\texttt{h2o.getModel()}}. This is helpful for  users that alternate between the web UI and the R API or multiple users accessing the same H2O instance.

In the following example, it is assumed that a GBM with the ID \texttt{GBM\_8e4591a9b413407b983d73fbd9eb44cf} is in the key-value (KV) store.

\subsection{Removing H2O Objects}


To remove an H2O object on the server associated with the object in the R environment, use {\texttt{h2o.rm()}}. For optimal performance, we recommend removing the object from the R environment as well using {\texttt{remove()}}, with the name of the object in the parentheses. If you do not specify an R environment, then the current environment is used.

\subsection{Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)}

To generate gradient boosted models for developing forward-learning ensembles, use {\texttt{h2o.gbm()}}.

\subsection{Generalized Linear Models (GLM)}


Generalized linear models (GLM) are some of the most commonly-used models for many types of data analysis use cases. While some data can be analyzed using general linear models, general linear models may not be as accurate if the variables are more complex. For example, if the dependent variable has a non-continuous distribution or if the effect of the predictors is not linear, generalized linear models will produce more accurate results than general linear models.

Generalized Linear Models (GLM) estimate regression models for outcomes following exponential distributions in general. In addition to the Gaussian (i.e. normal) distribution, these include Poisson, binomial, gamma and Tweedie distributions. Each serves a different purpose, and depending on distribution and link function choice, it can be used either for prediction or classification.

H2O's GLM algorithm fits the generalized linear model with elastic net penalties. The model fitting computation is distributed, extremely fast,and scales extremely well for models with a limited number ($\sim$ low thousands) of predictors with non-zero coefficients. The algorithm can compute models for a single value of a penalty argument or the full regularization path, similar to glmnet. It can compute Gaussian (linear), logistic, Poisson, and gamma regression models.

To generate a generalized linear model for developing linear models for exponential distributions, use {\texttt{h2o.glm()}}. You can apply regularization to the model by adjusting the lambda and alpha parameters.
For more information, use {\texttt{help(h2o.glm)}}.

\subsection{Predictions}
\label{ssec:Predictions}

The following section describes some of the prediction methods available in H2O.

{\textbf{Predict}}: Generate outcomes of a dataset with any model. Predict with GLM, GBM, Decision Trees or Deep Learning models.

{\textbf{Confusion Matrix}}: Visualize the performance of an algorithm in a table to understand how a model performs.

{\textbf{Area Under Curve (AUC)}}: A graphical plot to visualize the performance of a model by its sensitivity, true positives and false positives to select the best model.

{\textbf{Hit Ratio}}: A classification matrix to visualize the ratio of the number of correctly classified and incorrectly classified cases.

{\textbf{PCA Score}}: Determine how well your feature selection fits a particular model.

{\textbf{Multi-Model Scoring}}: Compare and contrast multiple models on a dataset to find the best performer to deploy into production.


To apply an H2O model to a holdout set for predictions based on model results, use {\texttt{h2o.predict()}}.
In the following example, H2O generates a model and then displays the predictions for that model.
For classification, the predict column is the model's discrete prediction, based on maximum F1 by default; the individual class probabilities are the remaining columns in the data frame.
It is common to utilize the p1 column for binary classification, if a raw probability is desired.
