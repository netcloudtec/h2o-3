# API Documentation

## Examples

The examples below provide a Rosetta Stone-like translation of common use cases across many language environments.

Goals include:

* Providing at least one environment that a person is familiar with to allow that person to explore a consistent workflow across the other, possibly unfamiliar, environments.

* To allow all the workflows to be stared at side-by-side to look for consistencies and inconsistencies during API design.


### Data science workflows
